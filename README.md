## About Atrium

Atrium is a social platform to unify BeCodians. The platform allows the user to get in touch with their peers and other coaches. The platform has several pages for different purposes. In the CodeQ&A for example, the user can ask questions, help or ask for feedback related to their code.

Atrium is build with Laravel-Breeze, ReactJS and is open-source based for BeCodians. The platform is meant to unify the students globally, but it is also a learning tool. A tool to be constantly improved and worked upon (within BeCode rules of course ;) ).

So, get in touch with your fellow BeCodians and push that button! For in BeCodians we trust!
